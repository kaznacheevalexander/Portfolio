                    <h2>about us</h2>
                    <p>Our objective is to generate positive risk-adjusted returns for its capital partners via the investment in property development projects and established property assets.</p>
                    <p>We believe our strengths lie in an established track record, the depth of its industry relationships and its collaborative approach to development. These strengths allow Henshall to connect quality international, national and local tenants with tailored development and asset solutions, first-class development and asset management teams, and patient sources of capital (institutional investors and high net worth individuals).</p>
                    <p>Henshall’s principals have expertise in managing and developing properties in the hotel (accommodation), retail, industrial, office, aged care and residential sectors, and Henshall is currently seeking development and established asset opportunities in each of these sectors.</p>
